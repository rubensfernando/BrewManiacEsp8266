# 4. Brew with Automatic mode

Automation is the heart of BrewManiacEx controller. The brew process starts from heating strike water to optional whirlpool and cooling. It prompts for user interactions, including:

-Malt In

-Malt Out

-Iodine test

-Hop throwing

You can always request to "refresh" LCD display by pressing <em>UP, DOWN, and START</em> simultaneously. Scrambled LCD display happens Due to the nature of I2C display. It's a quick solution to it.

## 4.1 Setup Automation

Before starting automation, the mash schedule, boil time, and hop time need to be specified. To edit the automation procedure, enter "Setup" then select “Automation”.

![image alt text](images/image_7.jpg)

The first item to edit  is the temperature of "Mash In", or the temperature of the strike water.

![image alt text](images/image_8.jpg)

Then, specify the first mash step temperature:

![image alt text](images/image_9.jpg)

and, the rest time.

![image alt text](images/image_10.jpg)

After entering the time by **Up/Down** buttons, press "**Done**"(Start button) if this is the final mash step(rest), or “**More**”(Enter button) if more rests are needed.

Repeat the input of temperature and time until all steps are input or the maximum 6 steps are input.

Then mashout temp and time:

![image alt text](images/image_12.jpg)

Input number of hops, **Boil Time, **and the time of each hop.

![image alt text](images/image_13.jpg)

The automation settings are saved. Therefore, if the same recipe is brewed, it is not necessary to setup again.

HopStand editing:

![image alt text](images/image_16.jpg)

A HopStand Session is a span of temperature range. Alarm for hop dropping is triggered at the time when "Start" temperature is reached, and the controller will try to "keep" the temperature not lower "Keep" temperature. 
If use of heating element is not desired, set "Keep temperature"  to a lower value. However, the "start" temperature of next session should be lower than previous “keep” temperature.  For example, if "Start" temperature is 100C/212F, and "Keep" temperature is 20C/68F for a hopstand duration 30 minutes. Prompt of hop dropping will be given at end of boil, and the timer of 30min hopstand starts. In general cases, the temperature won't drop to 20C/68F in 30 minutes without chilling operation. So the controller will just cout time without heating the wort.
If precise and specific temperature is desired, set the start and keep temperature to exact the same value.
Maximum number of sessions is 5.

![image alt text](images/image_17.jpg)

The "start" of hop stand. For FlameOut(KnockOff) hopping, set this number to greater or equal to boiling point. After boiling, when the temperature drops to this value, the controller will alarm to prompt for hop dropping and start counting time.

![image alt text](images/image_18.jpg)

The minimum temperature of this hopstand session. If the temperature drops below this setting before the specified hop time expires, the heating will be kicked. 

![image alt text](images/image_19.jpg)

Set the time of PostBoilHop #01. The first hop in the hopstand session defines the time of the hop stand. Press "Done" if no more hop, “More” else.

Repeat editing HopStand Session and PostBoilHop time until finished.

## 4.2 Running Automation

The automation will run through the brew process that is specified by the automation setup. When user interaction is needed, it will alert the user.

![image alt text](images/image_20.jpg)

During automated processes, like mashing and boil, additional control is possible. For example, the mash step can be skipped, and the pump can be controlled manually during mashing and boiling.

Automatic Brewing Screens:

* Delay Start

![image alt text](images/image_21.jpg)

If "Disable Delay Start" is set to “NO”, you will have the option to delay-start the brew. 

* Edit Delay Start Time

![image alt text](images/image_22.jpg)

Use Up/Down to change the delay time. 15min a step.

* Delay Start Waiting

![image alt text](images/image_23.jpg)

The brew process will begin after the time counts to zero. 

Go: start immediately.

Quit: quit the brew.

* Mashing

![image alt text](images/image_24.jpg)

Up/Down: adjust the setting temperature.

PmPus (Pump & Pause): Press to toggle pump.

      Long press to Pause the brew. 

STP: long press to extend or skip this rest step.

Multi-sensor Mashing Screen

![image alt text](images/image_25.jpg)

The upper reading is the main temperature reading which is under PID control.

The lower reading is AUXiliary temperature reading.

* Paused

![image alt text](images/image_26.jpg)

Paused mash step. The brew is paused until "Exit" pressed. The timer is stopped, as well as the pump and temperature control(heating).

* Modify Mash Step

![image alt text](images/image_27.jpg)

The mash step can be modified by **LONG PRESS** the "**STP**" button.

    * Extend: toggle rest extension. The extension status is displayed as "+" sign(exted) or nothing(no expend) after the “Mash 1/3" title line. 

    * Skip: Skip this rest step.

    *Back : back to mashing screen.

* Extended Mashing

![image alt text](images/image_28.jpg)

The duration of mash rest can be extended when necessary. It is useful under certain circumstances, like when decoction is used or the conversion hasn’t finished yet. When extended status is set, a "+"(plus sign) will be shown. When time runs out, the timer starts to **_count UP_**, and the “+”(plus sign) turns into “*”(star sign). 

![image alt text](images/image_29.jpg)

Press "STP" to finsih current rest step.

* Iodine Test

If enabled (skip iodine set to No), the controller will prompt for "Iodine Test" after last mash step finished and before Mashout start.

![image alt text](images/image_30.jpg)

If the Iodine test reveals the conversion is finished, press "M.Out" to go to mashout. If the conversionis not finished, press “Ext”. The last mashing step will be extended and run until “STP” is pressed.

* Before Boiling

![image alt text](images/image_31.jpg)

Up/Down: adjust target temperature.

Pmp: toogle pump.

START + ENTER: modify the boiling time. The timer will blink, entering editing mode. Any button and/or boiling temperature reaches results in confirmation of editing. The behavior is undefined if the boiling time is decreased to a value less than hopping time. 

* Boiling

![image alt text](images/image_32.jpg)

Up/Down: adjust target temperature or PWM.

Pause: pause timer. The timer will paused, but the heating control remain active. Use this to extend boil time when needed.

Pmp: toogle pump.

Note: Only when the temperature is higher than **_Target Temperature and the Boil Temperature _**will the heating be controlled by PWM, the PWM value will be shown.

Boiling Screen for Multi-sensor

![image alt text](images/image_33.jpg)

![image alt text](images/image_34.jpg)

The PWM duty cycle is displayed before the timer. When it is 100%, it is displayed as "HH%".

* HopStand

If hopstand is specified, the controller will prompt "chilling" to drop temperature for hopstand. (“Cooling” is for final cooling.)

![image alt text](images/image_35.jpg)

Press OK, and start chilling

![image alt text](images/image_36.jpg)

The temperature can be adjusted. The chilling can be skipped by **_LONG PRESS_** "Skip", and the controller will go to HopStand directly without checking the temperature.

![image alt text](images/image_37.jpg)

When temperature reaches the "start" temperature, the controller prompts for hop adding and start counting time. When time is up, the controller prompt for chilling again if another hopstand follows.

## 4.3 Automation Resumption

If a brew is not ended "normally" by pressing the “END” button after boiling finishes, the brew is considered “unfinished”, and BrewManiacEx will ask for resumption when entering automation.

The system will try to resume from last step. This feature is valid only after dough-in(mash-in). 

After version 0.5.2, an option name "Auto Resume". If it is enabled, the controller will try resuming automation process after 15 seconds from **power on** with no user intervention. This feature is designed to handle power shortage in the long brew day. The automatic resumption is available from the starting of **Delay Start**, so that if power shortage happens during the delay start, the automation process will be resumed. The "auto" resumption of automation brewing will work only when power shortage or reset **during** brewing process. If the brew process is interrupted by the user, the process will not be automatically resumed. However, it is still possible to resume the process manaully when asking.
